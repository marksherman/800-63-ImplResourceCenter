## Introduction

The recent publication of [NIST Special Publication 800-63B, Digital Identity Guidelines: Authentication and Lifecycle Management](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-63b) significantly updated authentication guidelines in previous editions of SP 800-63. These implementation resources provide additional non-normative information to agencies and others that are implementing and deploying authenticated systems based on SP 800-63B. These resources are intended to be a starting point for implementation decisions, focusing on typical authentication methodologies. It is of course not possible to anticipate every possible deployment variation or situation, so the absence of implementation information here should not be interpreted as discouraging any anticipated authentication methods.

These implementation resources should be read alongside SP 800-63B.
