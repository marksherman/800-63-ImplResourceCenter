# Digital Identity Guidelines: Implementation Resources

[NIST Special Publication 800-63-3](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63-3.html), *Digital Identity Guidelines*, is an umbrella publication that introduces the digitial identity model described in the SP 800-63-3 document suite. It frames identity guidelines in three major areas:
* Enrollment and identity proofing (SP 800-63A)
* Authentication and management of authentication lifecycle (SP 800-63B)
* Federation and assertions (SP 800-63C)

In addition to introducing the detailed guidelines in these areas, SP 800-63-3 addresses the factors involved in choosing the appropaiate Identity Assurance Level (IAL), Authentication Assurance Level (AAL), and Fedetation Assurance Level (FAL) for a given application. These are primarily risk-based decisions, and therefore interact with agencies' risk management processes.

SP 800-63-3 instructs federal agencies to apply their existing risk management processes in determining the levels of identity-related risks associated with their online services. Agencies apply their risk management processes to determine the appropriate Identity Assurance Level (IAL), Authenticator Assurance Level (AAL), and Federation Assurance Level (FAL), and then implement the application accordingly. While the requirements tell agencies _what_ they must do, it if up to agencies to decide _how_ they must do it. The purpose of the implementation resources provided herein is to assist agencies in assessing the level of identity-related risk associated with an online service. These resources may reference normative guidance in SP 800-63-3 and other documents to provide background information, but these resources themselves are not normative.

SP 800-63-3 requires each agency to produce a digital identity acceptance statement, so NIST has provided a template for agencies to adapt to meet their own needs. Feedback on implementation of the Digital Identity Risk Management Process per [OMB Memorandum M-19-17](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/M-19-17.pdf) should be delivered to NIST at [dig-comments@nist.gov](mailto:dig-comments@nist.gov).

As the identity risk assessment process is related to the Risk Management Framework (RMF), more information is provided to highlight the relationship between the two.

Finally, a list of key stakeholders and their roles and responsibilities in the digital identity risk assessment process is provided for agency consideration.
