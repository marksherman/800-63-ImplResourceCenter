**SP 800-63-3 Resources and Tools**

Special Publication 800-63-3, Digital Identity Guidelines, instructs federal agencies to apply their existing risk management processes in determining the levels of identity-related risks associated with their online services. SP 800-63-3 asks agencies to apply their risk management processes to various online services to determine their Identity Assurance Level, Authenticator Assurance Levels, or Federation Assurance Levels, and then implement the provided controls accordingly. While the requirements tell federal agencies _what_ they must do, it lacks specific guidance about _how_ they must do it. The purpose of the resources and tools provided herein is to assist agencies in determining the level of identity-related risk associated with an online service. These resources may reference normative guidance in SP 800-63-3 and other documents to provide background information, but the resources themselves provided herein are not normative.

Each agency is required, per NIST SP 800-63-3, to produce a digital identity acceptance statement, so NIST has provided a template for agencies to adapt to meet their own needs. Finalized digital identity acceptance statements should be delivered to NIST at XXXXXX per the [OMB Memorandum Strengthening the Cybersecurity of Federal Agencies through Improved Identity, Credential, and Access Management.](https://policy.cio.gov/identity-draft/)

As the identity risk assessment process is related to the Risk Management Framework (RMF), more information is provided to highlight the relationship between the two.

Finally, a list of key stakeholders and their roles and responsibilities in the digital identity risk assessment process is provided for agency consideration.
