NIST [Special Publication 800-63A](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63a.html) *Digital Identity Guidelines: Enrollment and Identity Proofing* provides detailed requirements for enrollment and identity proofing of individuals with which federal identity management systems are expected to comply.

The tools and resources here provide non-normative guidance to agencies and service providers on techniques to implement identity management systems that are aligned with the requirements contained in NIST SP 800-63A. These resources leverage examples and illustrative cases to provide practical and actionable guidance to readers.

Identity proofing is the process by which a Credential Service Provider (CSP) associates a specific person with an online identity. It does this by validating and verifying identifying evidence about a person for the purpose of issuing credentials to that person, as illustrated in the figure below. These processes, a component of the requirements in NIST SP 800-63-3, are intended to help agencies achieve the following objectives:

- **Resolution**: Establish that a claimed identity corresponds to a to a single, unique person within the context of the population of users served by the CSP.
- **Validation**: Confirm that all evidence that is supplied is valid (correct) and genuine (not counterfeit or misappropriated), and that the claimed identity exists in the real world.
- **Verification**:Â Determine that the provided evidence is associated with the real person supplying it.
