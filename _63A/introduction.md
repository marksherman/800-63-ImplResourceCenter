NIST Special Publication 800-63-A Digital Identity Guidelines: Enrollment and Identity Proofing (SP 800-63 or NIST SP 800-63A) provides detailed requirements for enrollment and identity proofing of individuals with which federal identity management systems are expected to comply.

The tools and resources here provide non-normative guidance to agencies and service providers on techniques to implement identity management systems which are aligned with the requirements contained in NIST SP 800-63A. These resources leverage examples and illustrative cases to provide practical and actionable guidance to readers.

Identity proofing is the process by which a Credential Service Provider (CSP) collects and verifies information about a person for the purpose of issuing credentials to that person, as illustrated in the figure below. These processes, consistent with the requirements in NIST SP 800-63-3, are intended to help agencies achieve the following objectives:

- **Resolve** a claimed identity to a single, unique identity within the context of the population of users served by the CSP.
- **Validate** that all evidence that is supplied is valid (correct) and genuine (not counterfeit or misappropriated); and that the claimed identity exists in the real world.
- **Verify** that the claimed identity is associated with the real person supplying the identity evidence.
